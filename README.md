# 911-calls

I have analysed some 911 calls data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields:

lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)

the project includes finding the most common reasons for the calls, and representing them on graphs along the days of the week, months of the year etc.
i have also found the regions from where the most number of 911 calls were made.
